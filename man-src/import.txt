## OPTIONS

* `<file>`:

	Path to a valid WXR file for importing.

* `--authors=<authors>`:

	How the author mapping should be handled. Options are 'create', 'mapping.csv', or 'skip'. The first will create any non-existent users from the WXR file. The second will read author mapping associations from a CSV, or create a CSV for editing if the file path doesn't exist. The last option will skip any author mapping.

* `--skip=<data-type>`:

	Skip importing specific data. Supported option is 'attachment'.
